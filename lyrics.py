They piled on the pain\nBut his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at\nFor the last fifty years they\'ve been searchin\' for that\nFreedom, oh freedom, freedom over me\nI hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free\nSend me some lovin\', then tell me no lie\nThrow the gun in the gutter and walk on by\nWake up, little Susie, let\'s go for a drive\nCross the Trinity River, let\'s keep hope alive\nTurn the radio on, don\'t touch the dials\nParkland Hospital, only six more miles\nYou got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead\nThat magic bullet of yours has gone to my head\nI\'m just a patsy like Patsy Cline\nNever shot anyone from in front or behind\nI\'ve blood in my eye, got blood in my ear\nI\'m never gonna make it to the new frontier\nZapruder\'s film, I\'ve seen that before\nSeen it thirty-three times, maybe more\nIt\'s vile and deceitful, it\'s cruel and it\'s mean\nUgliest thing that you ever have seen\nThey killed him once and they killed him twice\nKilled him like a human sacrifice\nThe day that they killed him, someone said to me, "Son\nThe age of the Antichrist has just only begun"\nAir Force One comin\' in through the gate\nJohnson sworn in at 2:38\nLet me know when you decide to throw in the towel\nIt is what it is, and it\'s murder most foul\n[Verse 4]\nWhat\'s new, pussycat?

Hey, are you ready for this?\nAre you hanging on the edge of your seat?\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust, yeah\nHey, I'm gonna get you too\nAnother one bites the dust\n[Verse 2]\nHow do you think I'm going to get along\nWithout you, when you're gone\nYou took me for everything that I had\nAnd kicked me out on my own\nAre you happy, are you satisfied?\nHow long can you stand the heat?\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat\nLook out\n[Chorus]\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust\nHey, I'm gonna get you, too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\n\n[Bridge]\nHey\nOh, take it\nBite the dust, hey\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust, ow\nAnother one bites the dust, hey hey\nAnother one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh\nOoh\n[Verse 3]\nThere are plenty of ways you can hurt a man\nAnd bring him to the ground\nYou can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad\nAnd leave him when he's down, yeah\nBut I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you\nI'm standing on my own two feet\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nRepeating the sound of the beat\nOh yeah\n[Chorus]\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust, yeah\nHey, I'm gonna get you, too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\n\n[Outro]\nShoot out\nAy-yeah\nAlright82EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy",
